### What is this?

This repository simply contains the IDL files extracted from the Chromium source repository using the [idl-extract](https://github.com/gwt-jsinterop/idl-extract)
script. These files are fed into the [generate-jsintrop](https://github.com/gwt-jsinterop/generate-jsinterop) application to generate GWT 2.8 JS interop interfaces and classes.
